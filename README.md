[Demo video](https://peertube.mastodon.host/videos/watch/26b0cb51-dcbf-4bf4-ab6d-557b3d6718be) on peertube.

This shader is strongly inspired by the fish shader used in [ABZU](http://www.abzugame.com/) and demonstrated by [Matt Nava](https://twitter.com/Matt_Nava) in his presentation at [GDC 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9NX06mvp2E).

The repository contains only what is absolutely necessary to demonstrate the shader. The shading of the object has to be refined.
